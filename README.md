I'm pretty sure that most of you have seen the video of [Mike Yeadon: The pandemic is over. There's herd immunity.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zfo0yg1mhp4).

Namely, to spread easily consumable hard facts, proving that freedom-robbing measures have zero impact on the virus prevalence. And that it is in fact, already behind us.

## How do we share this great news?

It would be a shame if this dangerous video was shared around the world [It's okay to be white style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_okay_to_be_white). The QR can be found on the website that you can reach by scanning the QR image in this posts image.

Be creative!
